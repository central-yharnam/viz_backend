Visual utils readme:

process_histogram(flag, array): there are 2 different kinds of histograms and they need to be processed 			        differently. there is the access frequency plot and the reuse distance 
				histogram. 


reuse_distrib(reuse_array): the helper method to actually process the list of reuses that is generated by the
			    stat generator.

visualize_data(flag, config, y_scale=None): this is one of the major functions, this calls many other functions
					    in the folders, checks if things exists, gets pertinent data, 					    		    processes it if necessary and then plots it.

config_permutation_gen(config, flags): this method goes through the config and generates all combinations of 				       algorithms and cache sizes parameters for each trace
				       in the config. this is necessary to make the fill comparison graphs.

s_generate_graph_data(config, params): downloads data if it exists in the database, generates it if not.

visualize_head_to_head(config, flag, y_scale = None): this method is used in visualapiEX to plot the fill 						      comparison graph for hit rate. For the webapp however, 						      this is not called.
gen_all_pairs(array): this is a helper function for visualize head to head. it does something similar to config
		      permutation gen. the difference is the formatting. config permutation gen is for the 		      webapp
